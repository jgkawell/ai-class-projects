My programming assignments for CS470 Artificial Intelligence.

## Descriptions of each program:

### ShapeFinder
A program that takes in grey-scale images with shapes overlaid on top and finds and labels the squares, rectangles, and circles in the image.

The images must be converted from .bmp files into files with no extension by using the ConvertBMP.exe file.

The files basic, given, and simple are example images to demo the program with.
